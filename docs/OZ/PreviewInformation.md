# PREVIEW INFORMATION

The ProjectOZ preview makes information about the NTAPI mechanisms used by ProjectOZ
available to interested faculty and our collaborators.

There is prototype code for SPACE.exe which implements the SPACE primitives.  It will
boot the skeletal BasicOZ and demonstrate how the trap, MMU, and CPU mechanisms work.

There will be a continuous stream of drops of ProjectOZ over the summer with increasing
amount of functionality in BasicOZ, as well as development of the first projects.

If you want to build and play with the code, you need the July WRK for the tools:
    set  wrk=the WRK directory
    set  projectoz=the ProjectOZ directory
    path %wrk%\tools\x86;%path%
    nmake -nologo x86=

To get on the list for notification of updates contact me directly, or if you'd rather
poll -- just check the curriculum website periodically.
