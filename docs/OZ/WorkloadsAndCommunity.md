# Workloads, Instrumentation, Community

If ProjectOZ proves to be a useful environment for teaching operating systems,
then over time much of the support will come from the academic community itself.
ProjectOZ will be extended to improve the accuracy of the instrumentation available
to students, and workloads will be developed that allow student projects to be
more accurately contrasted & compared.

Using WRK, the Windows Kernel itself may be extended to provide some of the
facilities that are currently not available to ProjectOZ (such as thread-virtual
time, reference & dirty bits for the shared memory section, 64KB pages).
