# Overview

ProjectOZ is an experimental environment based on the SPACE abstractions for
the CPU, MMU, and trap mechanisms (search: probert bruno SPACE).  ProjectOZ
implements these abstractions using the native NTAPI of the Windows kernel,
including features specific to building user-mode operating system
personalities (aka NT subsystems).

Because there is a real OS underneath handling the hardware details rather
than a simulator, students should find it easier to explore kernels at
the algorithm and data structure level rather than worrying about so many
low-level details.

ProjectOZ is provided in source form to universities worldwide. ProjectOZ is
continuing to evolve as contributors join the project.  Information on downloading
the latest version is available at:
